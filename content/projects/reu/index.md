I acted as a undergraduate researcher in RIT's 2017 Computational Sensing Research Experiences for Undergraduates. The project, funded by the National Science Foundation, explored quantifiable relationships between social media narratives, communities, and psychophysical signals such as galvanic skin response. For the project, I help create and operate an experiment that monitored and recorded 1140 participant response data points to several sets of tweets. The experiment itself was created using iMotions, with the respondent results processed and examined using a machine learning based classifier created using Scikit-learn.
