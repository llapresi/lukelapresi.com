The Reef is an exhibit that was showcased at Imagine RIT on April 27th, 2019. It set out to educate audiences of all ages about plastic pollution and encourage younger generations through social media and technology to become future environmental citizens.

I acted as the Lead Engineer of the main exhibit, a double-widescreen Unity experience played using smartphones as game controllers. I created the core WebSocket based network code fascilitating the communcation between the
smartphones and the main computer running the game, and created the core gameplay systems.

# Pitching the Project

When we started the creation of the project, the prompt given to us was a simple two word edict: "do good."
Plastic pollution was a problem we quickly brainstormed and agreed upon but we were initially stumped as to what form this creation would be.

Understanding that the two most important demographics to appeal to were families with young children and potential RIT students, we knew that we needed to create a simple to understand yet technologically novel
exhibit in the span around 6 months.

We knew we wanted to created something with a real sense of presence and spectacle,
and decided early on that we would use a double widescreen projection display inspired by
[previous Imagine RIT exibit *THARSIS*.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGYJ0FaGlvw)
*THARSIS* was a fairly static exibit however, and we wanted to one up it by creating something
more interactive. The idea of pulling a piece of trash off the main projector display and onto
a phone was an idea I brainstormed that seemed very inspiring to me, however the rest of the team
felt it might have been too ambitious given our 6 month development time. Nevertheless, I
felt strongly enough about the concept that I decided to create a quick and dirty proof of concept
to try and prove that the concept wasn't too out of reach.
